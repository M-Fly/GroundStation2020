# GroundStation 2020 Edition

## About
<ul>This project was created by Franklin Volcic for the 2020 Advanced Class MX6 plane. The code is written in Processing, using the Processing IDE. A java file is included for running the code in Eclipse.<br><br><b>Revisions</b><br></b>
 -Version 1.00: 5/22/2020</ul>

## Project
<ul>The goal of this project was to create a simple and intuitive data visualization engine. Data can easily be processed and visualized with the use of simple functions. When creating this engine, it slowly started becoming an engine for creating visual applications for users. Dropdown menus, buttons, graphs, serial moniters, preference file readers, are some of the programming additions that have been added. These all were important in creating what is known as the "Ground Station" for the MX6 plane. The Ground Station moniters real time data sent from the Advanced Class plane known as the MX6. This data must be read and processed quickly, as the one manning the ground station must be reading the data and using it to guide the pilot as he fly's. More can be learned about the entirty of the competition on the SAE Aero Design Website.</ul>

## Instal Information
<ul>To run this program on Windows, first download the zipped 32 bit application, or the zipped 64 bit application. Once the file has been downloaded, extract the folder. Both of the applications will have multiple folders, along with a preferences file and a .exe file. If the preferences file is missing, download the preferences file, and add it to the same folder as the .exe file. Then, simply open the .exe file. The application should start immediately.</ul>
<ul> <strong>Troubleshooting Startup</strong> <br> When attempting to download the application and run the application, you may get stuck on a blank grey screen. If this happens, it means the program is not responding. In the case of an unresponsive program, the most common issue is the program folder is missing the file Preferences.txt. Download the Preferences.txt file from githib, and add it to the program folder with the application. If this did not fix the issue, check if you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit application. If you are running the 32-bit application, try running the 64-bit application instead. Finally, make sure your java version is up to date. The 32-bit requires Java 10, and the 64-bit requires at least Java 8.</ul>
