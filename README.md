# GroundStation 2020 Edition

## About
<ul>This project was created by Franklin Volcic for the 2020 Advanced Class MX6 plane. The code is written in java, using the Processing IDE. A java file is included for running the code in Eclipse.<br><br><b>Revisions</b><br></b>
 -Version 1.00: 5/22/2020</ul>

## Instal Information
<ul>To run this program on Windows, first download the zipped 32 bit application, or the zipped 64 bit application. Once the file has been downloaded, extract the folder. Both of the applications will have multiple folders, along with a preferences file and a .exe file. If the preferences file is missing, download the preferences file, and add it to the same folder as the .exe file. Then, simply open the .exe file. The application should start immediately.</ul>
<ul> <strong>Troubleshooting Startup</strong> <br> When attempting to download the application and run the application, you may get stuck on a blank grey screen. If this happens, it means the program is not responding. In the case of an unresponsive program, the most common issue is the program folder is missing the file Preferences.txt. Download the Preferences.txt file from githib, and add it to the program folder with the application. If this did not fix the issue, check if you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit application. If you are running the 32-bit application, try running the 64-bit application instead. Finally, make sure your java version is up to date. The 32-bit requires Java 10, and the 64-bit requires at least Java 8.</ul>
